Description: Functions for downloading data from the Swiss
    National Bank (SNB; <https://www.snb.ch/>), the
    Swiss central bank.  The package is lightweight and
    comes with few dependencies; suggested packages are
    used only if data is to be transformed into
    particular data structures, for instance into 'zoo'
    objects. Downloaded data can optionally be cached,
    to avoid repeated downloads of the same files.
Suggests: jsonlite,zoo
