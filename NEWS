v0.2.0  (2023-12-11)

  o New functions "fetch_data", "fetch_last_update" and
    "fetch_info", which replace the previous functions that
    worked for only tables or datasets.

    the available information about identifiers/code lists.
    If package "jsonlite" is available, that information is
    readably arranged.

  o Experimental: "fetch_data" gains an argument
    "time.series".  If TRUE, tables and datasets are
    transformed into time-series.
